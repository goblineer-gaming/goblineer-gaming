Hello, I'm goblineer gaming.
I have a YT channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Hh2sYX6nAbSAK--IX7RTQ
Also a Discord server: https://discord.gg/pU5ArNNMXV
I mainly do some FNF coding, it sucks, but it's something I'm doing, I will now also be developing games in Unity, don't expect them to be good.
If you wanna improve on my current Extra Key Mod Pack, I'm more than happy, if you upload stuff about it on YT or something, GIVE CREDIT!
About the games I play: I mainly play TF2, Garry's Mod, FNF, Minecraft... Yeah pretty much.
I have no life because I have over 3,000 hours in TF2.
